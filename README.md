## How To Play
A random RBG color value is generated and you as the user have to select the corresponding color from the squares listed below.  The game can be played on "easy" mode (3 squares) or on "hard" mode (6 squares).  There is unlimited chances to guess so you can "always win", however you should try to do it in as little guesses as possible :).
